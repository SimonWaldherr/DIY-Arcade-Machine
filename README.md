## My Very Own Arcade Machine

Welcome to the DIY-Arcade-Machine project! This is a hands-on project to build your very own arcade machine using the Interstate 75 - RGB LED Matrix Driver from Pimoroni (PIM584), a 64x64 Pixel RGB LED Matrix with a Hub75 connector, and a KY-023 Joystick Module (or a Nunchuck). The project includes several games inspired by the classics: Simon, Snake, Qix, Breakout, Tetris, Asteroid, and Pong, all playable on a vibrant LED matrix display.

Donâ€™t have the hardware yet? You can still try out the games by running the [PyGame Branch](https://github.com/SimonWaldherr/DIY-Arcade-Machine/tree/pygame), which simulates the experience on your PC or Mac.

## Installation

### 1. Set up your Microcontroller with MicroPython
- Follow the instructions for your microcontroller to flash it with MicroPython.

### 2. Connect the Hardware
- Connect the Interstate 75 to the RGB LED Matrix using the Hub75 connector.
- Connect the Nunchuck to the microcontroller.

### 3. Upload the Code
- Use Thonny (or another compatible tool) to copy the provided Python script to your microcontroller.

## Usage

### 1. Power Up
- Ensure all connections are secure, then power up the microcontroller.

### 2. Start the Game Selector
- Once powered, the game selector interface will appear on the LED matrix.

### 3. Select a Game
- Use the joystick to navigate the menu and select a game. Press the joystick button to start.

### 4. Play
- Refer to the instructions below for controls on each game.

### 5. Exit a Game
- To exit a game and return to the menu, press both joystick buttons simultaneously.

## Games

### Simon
A memory game where the player must recall and repeat a sequence of colors.
- **Controls**: Use the joystick to select the flashed color. Repeat the sequence as it grows.

### Asteroid
A classic shooter where the goal is to destroy asteroids.
- **Controls**: Use the joystick to rotate and move your ship. Press the button to shoot.

### Snake
Guide the snake to eat targets and grow in length, but avoid hitting the walls or yourself.

### Breakout
Break the bricks with the ball without letting it fall off the screen.
- **Controls**: Use the joystick to move the paddle left and right. Break as many bricks as possible!

### Qix
Claim territory while avoiding enemies. Move strategically to win.
- **Controls**: Move with the joystick to claim territory while avoiding enemy contact.  
  - For a version written in Go using the Ebiten engine, [click here](https://github.com/SimonWaldherr/golang-examples/blob/master/non-std-lib/ebiten-qix.go).

### Tetris
Stack blocks to form complete lines and score points.
- **Controls**: Use the joystick to move and rotate the blocks. Speed them up by moving them down.

### Maze
A simple maze game
